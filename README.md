I will leave the details of the exercise to your imagination. You will need to use an AnimatedSprite3D node for the explosion, and you will need to use at least two CPUParticles or Particles emitters. Maybe the Player/Pivot/Laser mesh will help?

When you are happy with the result, go to Project->Export. Tap Addâ€¦ and then select Mac OSX. The default settings should work; export the project as project.dmg. If Godot tells you to download a template or other resources, follow those steps until you are able to export the file.

If you are not using a Mac, feel free to export other project types to test. 

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-05i-3D-Particles) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
